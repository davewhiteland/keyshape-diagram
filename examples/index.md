title: Keyshape Diagram examples
---

The examples are showing implementation (i.e., for you to look in the source)
rather than the diagramming possibilities.

Examples:

_HTTP request/response sequence example_

* [using external files](ksd-example-external)
* [using inline content](ksd-example-inline-embedded) with Keyshape JS embedded in the SVG
* [using inline content](ksd-example-inline-external) with Keyshape JS external, but in-line
* [showing double deployment](double)
